== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get URL of my status? =

Just right click on the date/time of the status in facebook. You will get option to copy the link URL. 
Or, click on the status date, it will go to status page. Copy the URL from address bar of the browser.


= I just pasted a URL in its own line. But it is appearing as it is in the post. Any settings needed? =

As of 3.5, Auto-embeds are automatically enabled and there is no setting to turn them off in the WordPress admin pages. Prior to 3.5, there was an "Auto-embeds" checkbox in Administration > Settings > Media SubPanel.

Also make sure you have pasted the URL as plain text and not as hyperlink.
